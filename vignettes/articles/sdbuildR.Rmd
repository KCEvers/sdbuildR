```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(sdbuildR)
```

### Get started with a template

Stock-and-flow models can be created in three ways in sdbuildR. Firstly, dozens of example models can be loaded using `xmile()`. Plot the stock-and-flow diagram to get an overview of the model:

```{r SIR_diagram, fig.width=8, fig.height=2}
sfm <- xmile("SIR")
plot(sfm)
```

The model can be simulated using `simulate()`:

```{r SIR_plot, fig.width=8, fig.height=4}
sim <- simulate(sfm)
plot(sim)
```

### Import models from Insight Maker

Secondly, an [Insight Maker](https://insightmaker.com/) model can be imported to R using its URL: 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
URL <- "https://insightmaker.com/insight/5LxQr0waZGgBcPJcNTC029/Crielaard-2022"
sfm <- insightmaker_to_sfm(URL = URL)
```

```{r}
sim <- simulate(sfm)
```

```{r Crielaard2022_plot, fig.height=4, fig.width=8, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot(sim)
```

### Build a model from scratch

Lastly, a stock-and-flow model can be created from scratch. We first initialize an empty stock and flow model with `xmile()`, and then use `build()` to create a logistic model of population growth. The simulation specifications, such as the start time, stop time, and simulation time step (`dt`), are set with `sim_specs()`. Custom units such as people can be added with `model_units()`. Below, we make use of the convenient pipe operator `|>`, which simply passes the result of an expression to the next expression as a first argument. 

```{r logistic_plot, fig.width=8, fig.height=4}
sfm <- xmile() |>
  header(name = "Population growth") |>
  build("X", "stock", eqn = ".01", label = "Population size") |>
  build("change", "flow",
    eqn = "r * (1 - X/K)", to = "X",
    label = "Births and Deaths"
  ) |>
  build("r", "constant", eqn = "0.1", label = "Growth rate") |>
  build("K", "constant", eqn = "1", label = "Carrying capacity") |>
  sim_specs(stop = 200)
plot(simulate(sfm))
```

An overview of the model components and simulation specifications can be accessed with `summary()`:

```{r summary}
summary(sfm)
```

To quickly view all model variable properties, use `as.data.frame()`:

```{r as.data.frame}
as.data.frame(sfm)
```
