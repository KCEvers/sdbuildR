Description: Stock-and-flow models are a computational method from the field of 
    system dynamics. They represent how systems change over time and are 
    mathematically equivalent to ordinary differential equations. 'sdbuildR'
    (system dynamics builder) provides an intuitive interface for constructing 
    stock-and-flow models without requiring extensive domain knowledge. Models 
    can quickly be simulated and revised, supporting iterative development. 
    'sdbuildR' simulates models in 'R' and 'Julia', where 'Julia' offers unit
    support and large-scale ensemble simulations. Additionally, 'sdbuildR' can 
    import models created in 'Insight Maker' (<https://insightmaker.com/>).
