# sdbuildR: Stock-and-flow modelling with R

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Easily build and simulate stock-and-flow models with sdbuildR in R. With Julia as a backend, sdbuildR combines fast performance with flexibility in a user-friendly R environment.

## Installation

You can install the development version of sdbuildR like so:

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("KCEvers/sdbuildR")
```

sdbuildR offers two simulation engines: R and Julia. If you would like to use units and delay functions, you will need to set up the Julia environment. Run `sdbuildR_setup()` to install Julia and required packages (initial setup may take 5â€“15 minutes):

```{r installing Julia, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
sdbuildR::sdbuildR_setup()
```
