Model systems as stock-and-flow models in R. Stock-and-flow models are foundational to system dynamics, and help to understand systems complicated by nonlinearities, delays, and feedback loops. sdbuildR aims to make stock-and-flow modeling accessible and effortless, enabling you to dedicate your expertise to what matters most: building insightful, high-quality models. Get started at [https://kcevers.github.io/sdbuildR/](https://kcevers.github.io/sdbuildR/)!

## Features

* **Accessibility**: Get started with stock-and-flow models with limited knowledge.
* **Flexibility**: Modify your models easily and robustly.
* **Insight Maker integration**: Import models from [Insight Maker](https://insightmaker.com/).
* **Julia backend**: Use Julia for high-performance simulations, without any knowledge of Julia.
* **Unit support**: Use standard or custom units to verify and interpret your model. 

All package capabilities are described in the vignettes:

* [Build](https://kcevers.github.io/sdbuildR/articles/build.html): Learn how to build, modify, and debug stock-and-flow models.
* [Julia setup](https://kcevers.github.io/sdbuildR/articles/julia-setup.html): Install and set up the Julia environment for running ensemble simulations and using units.
* [Ensemble](https://kcevers.github.io/sdbuildR/articles/ensemble.html): Learn how to assess a model's sensitivity, uncertainty and robustness with ensemble simulations.
* [Units](https://kcevers.github.io/sdbuildR/articles/units.html): Learn why and how to use (custom) units.



## Installation

The release version can be installed from CRAN:

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
install.packages("sdbuildR")
```

The development version can be installed from GitHub:

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
if (!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("KCEvers/sdbuildR")
```

sdbuildR offers two simulation engines: R and Julia (supported by [JuliaConnectoR](https://github.com/stefan-m-lenz/JuliaConnectoR/)). If you would like to run ensemble simulations and use units, you will need to install and set up the Julia environment. See [this vignette](https://kcevers.github.io/sdbuildR/articles/julia-setup.html) for guidance.

## Limitations

* Unlike in other system dynamics software, sdbuildR provides only minimal support for non-negative stocks and flows. Specifically, setting stocks to non-negative will constrain the stocks to remain non-negative, but will not adjust the corresponding flows. In any case, enforcing either stocks or flows to be non-negative is not recommended, as it may mask model misspecification. Stocks and flows that logically cannot be negative (e.g., animals or deaths) should ideally remain non-negative as a result of the model's equations and parameters, rather than by forcing them to be non-negative. 

* sdbuildR does not support vectorized operations, destructuring assignment, or minimum and maximum constraints for variables. 

* sdbuildR does not support the Insight Maker functions Stop(), Prompt(), Confirm(), Pause(), Fix(), Map(), Filter(), and Repeat(), nor the delay and past functions. A message is issued if any of these are detected.

## Other system dynamics software

sdbuildR is heavily based on common system dynamics software such as [Vensim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vensim), [Powersim](https://powersim.com/), [Stella](https://www.iseesystems.com/), and [Insight Maker](https://insightmaker.com/). To translate xmile models to R, see the R package [readsdr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=readsdr). To build stock-and-flow models with the R package [deSolve](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=deSolve), the book [System Dynamics Modeling with R](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-34043-2) by Jim Duggan will prove useful. In Python, stock-and-flow models are supported by [PySD](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.04329).


## Troubleshooting

sdbuildR is under active development. While thoroughly tested, the package may have bugs, particularly in complex model translations. We encourage users to report [issues on GitHub](https://github.com/KCEvers/sdbuildR/issues) - your input helps the package improve! Use `debugger()` to diagnose model errors, and use the vignettes for guidance.
