\title{Debug stock-and-flow model}
\usage{
debugger(sfm, quietly = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{sfm}{Stock-and-flow model, object of class sdbuildR_xmile.}

\item{quietly}{If TRUE, don't print problems. Defaults to FALSE.}
}
\value{
Logical value indicating whether any problems were detected.
}
\description{
Check for common formulation problems in a stock-and-flow model.
}
\details{
The following problems are detected:
\itemize{
\item An absence of stocks
\item Flows without a source (\code{from}) or target (\code{to})
\item Flows connected to a stock that does not exist
\item Connected stocks and flows without both having units or no units
\item Undefined variable references in equations
\item Circularities in equations
\item Missing unit definitions
}

The following potential problems are detected:
\itemize{
\item Absence of flows
\item Stocks without inflows or outflows
\item Equations with a value of 0
}
}
\examples{
# No issues
sfm = xmile("SIR")
debugger(sfm)

# Detect absence of stocks or flows
sfm = xmile()
debugger(sfm)

# Detect stocks without inflows or outflows
sfm = xmile() \%>\% build("Prey", "stock")
debugger(sfm)

# Detect circularities in equation definitions
sfm = xmile() \%>\% build("Prey", "stock", eqn = "Predator") \%>\%
 build("Predator", "stock", eqn = "Prey")
debugger(sfm)
