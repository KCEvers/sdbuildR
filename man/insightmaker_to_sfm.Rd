\title{Import Insight Maker model}
\usage{
insightmaker_to_sfm(
  URL,
  filepath_IM,
  keep_nonnegative_flow = TRUE,
  keep_nonnegative_stock = FALSE,
  keep_solver = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{URL}{URL to Insight Maker model. Character.}

\item{filepath_IM}{File path to Insight Maker model. Only used if URL is not specified. Needs to be a character with suffix .InsightMaker.}

\item{keep_nonnegative_flow}{If TRUE, keeps original non-negativity setting of flows. Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{keep_nonnegative_stock}{If TRUE, keeps original non-negativity setting of stocks Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{keep_solver}{If TRUE, keep the ODE solver as it is. If FALSE, switch to Euler integration in case of non-negative stocks to reproduce the Insight Maker data exactly. Defaults to FALSE.}
}
\value{
Stock-and-flow model of class xmile.
}
\description{
Import a stock-and-flow model from \href{https://insightmaker.com/}{Insight Maker}. Models may be your own or from another user. Importing causal loop diagrams or agent-based models is not supported.
}
\details{
Insight Maker models can be imported using either a URL or an Insight Maker file. Ensure the URL refers to a public (not private) model. To download a model file from Insight Maker, first clone the model if it is not your own. Then, go to "Share" (top right), "Export", and "Download Insight Maker file".
